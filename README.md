# Starfiles-JSDelivr
This repository is a dump of static javascript files Starfiles uses. Obviously, not all javascript files used by Starfiles are listed here, only select ones are.
I don't really recommend using most of this as it's built for Starfiles and 90%, it won't be useful for other websites. functions.js is my "mini jquery".
Starfiles doesn't use JQuery, instead any jquery feature that is needed, is remade using vanilla js and put into functions.js. functions.js is pretty much designed
to fix all annoyances I've faced in JS, with some cool functions worth taking a look at.
